# Predicting NBA Contracts

This is an individual research project for course CS 363D: Introduction to Data Mining
at The University of Texas at Austin.

## Problem
Can we predict the contracts that teams will give to a player in free agency?

## Data Sources
Salary/Contracts History 
    Salary information going back to 2009/2010 can be found on www.shamsports.com.
    TODO: Find information going back to preferably at least the 2003/2004 season.
Free Agent Lists
    Can be found both on www.shamsports.com and www.nba.com.
Player Performance Data
    Box Score data can be found on www.basketball-reference.com.
    Some advanced stats can also be found there.
    More advanced stats can be found on www.82games.com

## Thoughts
Assumption: Contracts are dealt based on supply and demand.
        1. Classify a player by position and skill
    To determine supply:
        2. Look at the depth of free agency of similar players
    To determine demand:
        3. Look at depth of teams which require that class of player
    To determine result:
        4. Look at some kind of average of contract given to this class of player
        5. Weight based on supply and demand

    If we can do part (1), then parts (2) and (4) are straightforward.
    Part (5) can be done through trial and error.
    Therefore, the most difficult parts are part (1) and part (3):
        How do we classify players?
        How do we determine what players a team wants?
    Those two questions practically require their own research papers...

Another Convenient Assumption: If a team needs a player, it will affect the market,
    no matter their current financial situation (i.e. don't worry about cap space).
Another Convenient Assumption: CBA changes have no additional affect on contracts 
    outside of the affect on Supply and Demand.
