TODO:
1.
    Priority now is to fix kmeans
    Remove cosine similarity
    KMeans should use SSE
    Try different feature sets.
    Try PCA.
    Try KNN vs. KMeans.
    Finish clustering before anything else. If all else fails, I can just turn in this part.

    Regression Model


* Finish k-means
    Should numbers be scaled? Use cosine similarity??
* Preprocess should create matrix for kmeans
    Removing values such as Gm

Other models:
PCA + KNN?
